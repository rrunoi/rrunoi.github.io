### HTML

Basic HTML was used. There is a link in the head element for font-awesome was used to get the icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and @ symbol. In the body element each different part is put in its own section element. A comment is placed above each section indicating the topic for the section.

### CSS

The CSS used was also just basic CSS. The styles.css page is sorted starting with the HTML elements followed by classes, IDs, and ending with media queries.

I used linear gradient to color the background of the body and navbar. Most of the sections make use of the flexbox for positioning the elements.

### Still to add

I still need to add some projects to the Projects section.

              Originally from the United States I now live with my family as a
              permanent resident in Finland. I am currently a Business
              Information Technology student at Haaga-Helia with an emphasis on
              software development. With the experience I have mostly being on
              the frontend I would like start in a frontend position, but I
              would like to learn more about both front and backend. I am an
              easy-going person who can work in a group or by myself. I have a
              beginner level understanding of Finnish and I am looking to
              improve this as well.
              <br /><br />
              During my studies I have worked as part of a scrum team on two
              occasions. During the first of these projects, we worked in two
              week sprints. For this project I started on a team working with
              database creation and setup. Upon completion of the database work
              the members moved to other teams, and I was moved to the frontend.
              While on the frontend team I worked with creating charts the user
              could select the types of data they wanted in the chart or graph
              and that data would be pulled from the database and put in the
              chart. I also worked with the team who was responsible for setting
              up the page theme. We selected colors and the general page layout.
              The second project I worked on I was on the IoT team. This team
              was responsible for getting the PIR sensor to work with the esp32
              board and send messages to the backend using an MQTT broker. The
              DB administrator was also able to ping each board to ensure they
              were working if a signal had not been sent for a while.
